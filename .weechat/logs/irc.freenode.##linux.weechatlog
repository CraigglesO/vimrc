2016-04-12 22:21:13	winsoff	I guess my further question is to ask if mounting a single .bin file that has a filesystem inside of it can lead to you just having a little filestructure that is just encapsulated inside the .bin.
2016-04-12 22:21:44	[R]	winsoff: once you mount it, its exactly the same thing as mounting a drive
2016-04-12 22:22:00	winsoff	[R], so then things inside of it get treated as its own little file world?
