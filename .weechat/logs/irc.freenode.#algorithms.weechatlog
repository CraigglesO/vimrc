2016-04-12 19:50:54	oconnorct1	BFS is more important to learn right now.

2016-04-12 19:53:31	realz	its obviously more complicated
2016-04-12 19:53:58	realz	there is also the posibility of iterating with O(1) memory if you have parent pointers which is cool

2016-04-12 19:56:26	oconnorct1	and I'm starting to get it.
2016-04-12 19:56:26	flebron	For instance, Introduction to Algorithms.
2016-04-12 19:56:32	flebron	The first chapters are about asymptotic notation.
2016-04-12 19:56:43	oconnorct1	I ahve been using The algorithm design manual

2016-04-12 20:01:05	flebron	Don't try to understand BFS if you don't first understand basic algorithms like loops, and basic data structures like queues and stacks.
2016-04-12 20:01:21	oconnorct1	No I do.
2016-04-12 20:01:24	oconnorct1	I completely do.
2016-04-12 20:01:45	flebron	Then read that book and see what you know and don't know.

2016-04-12 20:11:04	realz	the O(n^2) is simply because the maximum number of edges in a graph is O(n^2)
2016-04-12 20:11:16	realz	and in the worst case BFS on a graph will have to look at every edge
2016-04-12 20:11:46	realz	"The time complexity can be expressed as O(|V|+|E|)O(|V|+|E|),[5] since every vertex and every edge will be explored in the worst case. |V||V| is the number of vertices and |E||E| is the number of edges in the graph. Note that O(|E|)O(|E|) may vary between O(1)O(1) and O(|V|2)O(|V|2), depending on how sparse the input graph is." (copypaste from wikipedia)
