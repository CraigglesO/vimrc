2016-04-12 23:11:49	asteele	sorry but just got off long day at work so my patience is already gone ;)
2016-04-12 23:12:07	inflames	asteele has been nice too, most will just not even respond when they don't wanna deal
2016-04-12 23:12:21	gambl0re	can you just tell me where in the mongodb docs that it says to create this data/db directory
2016-04-12 23:12:23	gambl0re	just so i know
2016-04-12 23:12:31	asteele	[20:08:26]  <asteele>	it should probably mention that defaults are different on each os
2016-04-12 23:12:32	gambl0re	maybe im blind
2016-04-12 23:12:40	asteele	[20:08:35]  <asteele>	but that is left for you to figure out :P
2016-04-12 23:12:51	inflames	gambl0re, each os does it differently and does different stuff out of the box
2016-04-12 23:13:00	inflames	windows might not need to create it, but ubuntu might

2016-04-12 23:37:20	asteele	inflames not that bad, i prefer to break everything down into components at a higher level though, so like components/user/models/user.model.js  components/authentication/services/auth.service.js components/user/routes/routes.js etc.  i find it more suitable for large applications that have continually expanding features
2016-04-12 23:37:53	asteele	also all of that is in a /src/ directory, since everything gets babel'd and such into a /dist directory

2016-04-12 23:41:46	inflames	see one reason i'd gone for the approach of structuring by component base rather than by the component type is that types sometimes become hard to decide (oop problem) and then to grab the code and stick it into another project becomes difficult to find all the parts
